# NLP_FinalProject

This project analyzes the relationship between sentiment and user engagement (retweets and favorites) in Donald Trump's tweets. We leverage two sentiment analysis models—Vader (rule-based) and Hugging Face (transformer-based)—to quantify sentiment and study its correlation with engagement metrics. The project involves cleaning raw tweet data, computing sentiment scores, and visualizing trends through various plots and regression analysis.
